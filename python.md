 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

1: This part marks the function as a function.
2: The name of the function.  
3: Parameter of the function.
4: Block or indented block of code. This marks what is in the function and what is out of the function. Everything in the block is in the function.
5: Variable.
6: Return is a command which will stops the function and will return something.

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
[The constructor is the method we use in classes. When we create a new objective, based on a class, the constructor will automatically build the objective based on the method we created the constructor. So the constructor will setup the new objective.]
